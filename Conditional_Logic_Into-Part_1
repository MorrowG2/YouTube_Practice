# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Questions
#
# 1. Adjust the variables to print out the following statement
# 'This is the scope of the 2nd elif condition.'
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Adjust the variables to print out the 'else condition'
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Consider what will be printed out in the "scope" of the "if" keyword if it is True?
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
variable_1 = True
variable_2 = True
variable_3 = True
variable_4 = True

if variable_1:
    print('This is the scope of the if condition.')
elif variable_2:
    print('This is the scope of the 1st elif condition.')
elif variable_3:
    print('This is the scope of the 2nd elif condition.')
elif variable_4:
    print('This is the scope of the 3rd elif condition.')
else:
    print('This is the scope fo the else condition.')

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The below questions are Advanced and they were not covered in the video.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We did not go over the below questions but they are important and the answers can be found at the ANSWERS SECTION
# 4. Can you print out BOTH an 'elif' and an 'if' statement?
# (HINT) - When in doubt RUN the CODE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Can you have an 'if' statement inside of an 'if' statement?
# I briefly covered this.
# There will be a follow-up video to cover scope within a scope.
# Run the code in the examples below and try to figure out why the conditions are triggerd.

# 1.

# variable_3 = True

# 2.

# 3. If the "if" keyword is True then
# 'This is the scope of the 'if' condition.' - will be printed out
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Only ONE condition will be triggered if the condition is TRUE.
# An 'elif' and an 'if' statement cannot both be triggered even if they are BOTH TRUE.
# If BOTH are TRUE, then the FIRST condition (the condition on ABOVE the other condition) will be triggered
# and the SECOND (BOTTOM) condition will be skipped over.

# The below examples are Advanced and they were not covered in the video.

# 5. Yes, you can have an 'if' statement inside of an 'if' statement and you can have an
# 'if' statement inside of all other statements

# There are 3 examples below showing an 'if' statement inside of additional statements.
# Take your time with the below. Digest it. Run the code.

# Why is the second 'if' condition being triggered for each example below?
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# # Example 1 ---- *When in doubt run the code.*
# of_age2 = True
# if of_age2:
#     print('This is True.')
#     x = 0
#     if x is 1:
#         print("X = 0")
#     else:
#         print("Not today.")
# else:
#     print('This is not true')
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# # Example 2 --- *When in doubt run the code.*
# of_age2 = False
# not_of_age = True
#
# if of_age2: # This is False so the scope will be skipped.
#     print('This is True.')
#     x = 0
#     if x is 1:
#         print("X = 0")
#     else:
#         print("Not today.")
#
# elif not_of_age: # This is True so the scope will be called.
#     print('You are not of age.')
#     x = 2
#     if x is 2: # This is True, x does = 2
#         print("Yep, x is 2")
#         # Notice there is NO "else" statement. We do not need an "else" statement with an "if" statement.
#         # It is good practice to use an "else", but you do not need an "else" statement
# else:
#     print('This is not true')
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# # Example 3 --- *When in doubt run the code.*
# of_age2 = False
# not_of_age = False
#
# if of_age2: # This is False so the scope will be skipped.
#     print('This is True.')
#     x = 0
#     if x is 1:
#         print("X = 0")
#     else:
#         print("Not today.")
#
# elif not_of_age: # This is True so the scope will be called.
#     print('You are not of age.')
#     x = 2
#     if x is 2: # This is True, x does = 2
#         print("Yep, x is 2")
#         # Notice there is NO "else" statement. We do not need an "else" statement with an "if" statement.
#         # It is good practice to use an "else", but you do not need an "else" statement
# else:
#     print('This is not true')
#     y = 0
#     if y is 0:
#         print("The 'else' scope is being printed. Even though the 'if' scope has been called.")
#         print("The 'if' scope is inside of the 'else' scope. Essentially a scope within a scope.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bonus - Can you adjust the variable of each example above to have a different condition triggered?
# Can you create your own example of a scope within a scope?
